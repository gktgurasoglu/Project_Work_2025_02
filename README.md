 Marketing Campaign Performance Analysis


One of the main objectives of this project is to demonstrate my ability to manipulate data using the Python programming language.
In this context:
Data analysis steps were applied to the dataset using the Python - Pandas library.
Meaningful graphs were created from the dataset using the Python - Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries.


The ability to create and combine various types of graphs, from simple linear graphs to more advanced visualizations using Matplotlib,  
The ability to adjust the parameters of graphs and diagrams to ensure maximum clarity and transparency,  
The ability to analyze relationships and dependencies in data using Seaborn,
Methods for creating graphs for categorical data,
How to present linear regression modeling results, can be found in this project.

You can review the project under five main headings:   
 01 Info:    
   In this section, you can find an explanation of the roadmap followed.   
 02 Dataset:    
   You can access the file used.   
 03 Jupyter Notebook:    
   You can access the code containing data manipulation performed with Python pandas and visualizations performed with matplotlib and seaborn.


Steps implemented in the project:

1. Group the data by day and create the following two graphs for the grouped data:
  A graph showing the total daily advertising expenditure in 2021;
  A graph showing the daily ROMI in 2021. Bonus Task: Use the rolling() method to show the moving average expenditure and ROMI.

2. Group the data by campaign name and create two graphs:
  A graph showing the total advertising spend for each campaign;
  A graph showing the overall ROMI for each campaign.

3. Use a box plot to determine the distribution of daily ROMI for each campaign.

4. Create a histogram showing the distribution of ROMI values in the facebook_ads_data.csv table.

5. Create a heat map of the correlation between all numerical indicators in the facebook_ads_data.csv table. Which indicators have the highest and lowest correlation? Which factors are correlated with “total_value”?

6. Create a scatter plot with linear regression based on the “total_spend” and “total_value” data to visualize the relationship between the variables.

First, we examine the data set:
  Column names,
  Data types,
  Empty data,
  Missing data,
  Is there any duplicate data?
This gives us a general overview of our data set.

If there are any incorrect values, we correct them. (These corrections are handled in different ways depending on the category of the error and the status of the values.)
In our dataset:
  The data type of the date column,
  cpc, cpm, ctr, and romi empty values have been corrected.

We examine the basic statistical properties of the columns containing numerical values in our dataset.
This helps us understand what kind of dataset we are working with and how to proceed.

Finally, we carry out the tasks requested of us step by step.
